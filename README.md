# Hurricane-Damage-Detection
**Hurricane Damage Detection using Neural Networks** involves using deep learning models, typically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to analyze satellite or aerial images of areas affected by hurricanes. The model detects and classifies damage such as flooded areas, building destruction, or infrastructure loss
